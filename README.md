# Anomaly-Detection-and-Segmentation-Yolo-V5

Metal laser melting manufacturing (MAM) has been widely applied in the medical industry, manufacturing, aerospace, and boutique industries in recent years. 
However, defects during the selective laser melting (SLM) manufacturing process can result from thermal stress or hardware failure during the selective laser melting (SLM) manufacturing process.
To improve the product’s quality, the use of defect detection during manufacturing is necessary. 

# Objective

An accurate detection of defects is very important. There are three powder-spreading defect types: powder uneven, powder uncovered, and recoated scratches.

Target: Automatically detect and segment the defect during manufacturing.

Step 1. Detect defects from the provided image.

Step 2.  Segment the defective area in the meantime.
